Within this repository, I am putting my newly found CSS skills to the test.
Particularly when it comes to **flexboxes**.

I may need to come back and refactor my code, as the current implementation is 
(I believe) inefficient and could do with some reusable classes to cut down on
 the amount of CSS written.

 For instance, I could make reusable classes for:
  - The different coloured backgrounds (white, blue, navy)
  - Font sizes and weights
  - Widths and flexbox properties

  Overall I am pretty happy with how it turned out. Flexboxes seem pretty intuitive now.
